                        1. INTRODUCTION                        


The AXAF Guide and Acquisition Star Catalog (AGASC) is presented in
this set of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, and may
be distributed in a variety of formats, including DAT (DDS format)
or CD-ROM (compact disc, read only memory in ISO 9660 format).  This
issue, Version 1.6, corresponds to the AGASC as completed 16 November 2004. 

AGASC1.6 can be roughly considered as the superset of the best data
available for each of 18865968 listed stars, taken from the following
catalogs: Tycho-2 and GSC-ACT.  Additional derived quantities are
included that are useful for Chandra operations, primarily the
expected magnitude in the Chandra Aspect Camera (Ball Aerospace &
Technologies Corp).  Further details of AGASC1.6 history and
construction are elaborated in the comments.txt file of the table
subdirectory.  

                                                                     

                      2.   ORGANIZATION OF THE DATA FILES          

                                        
The top directory includes the files
----------------------------------------------------------------        
  readme.txt    - Introduction. ASCII

                  small region. ASCII  
----------------------------------------------------         

As a result of merging of the GSC1.1 with the PPM and with the TYC,
and for expected merges with other catalogs in the future, we have
extended the GSC format to include new information and references.
Published data include position, proper motion, epoch, parallax, a
magnitude, up to 2 colors, multiplicity and variability flags, and
source catalog IDs.  Cross-references are included separately for 1)
position 2) mag 3) color 4) proper motion (p.m.), 5) parallax, and 6)
variability. Derived data include MAG_ACA, MAG_ACA_ERR, a high
p.m. flag ASPQ2, and spoiler star codes ASPQ1, and ASPQQ1-6, which
potentially relieve the Chandra Off-Line System Star Selection
Algorithm (SSA) of such computations.  

 The AGASC stars are grouped with regions tables, as in the original
HST GSC.  The AGASC consists of about 9537 regions tables containing
about 2,000 objects each.  These will remain in FITS BINTABLE format,
with the directory structure described in FITS TABLE format.  Stars
from constituent catalogs that were not matched to the original GSC1.1
are included within the appropriate regions table based on region
boundaries in RA and DEC. Cross-references to the original star ID
numbers XREF_IDx are included from the original x=1-6 catalogs we 
have matched.


		3. SUMMARY OF THE AGASC1.6 FORMAT

  Each FITS regions table in the AGASC1.6 consists of 3 parts, the
primary header, the table header, and the table data. The conventions
for FITS Binary Tables are detailed in Cotton, Tody and Pence (1995,
A&A, 113, 159), or at http://fits.nrao.edu/FITS.html

The length of the header information is the same for all the AGASC
regions tables.  That length is 5x2880= 14400bytes. After these 14400
bytes comes star data records. 

 The data for each star amounts to 122 bytes, in 47 data columns for
AGASC1.6.  Default values are -9999 or 0 where no data are available.
Many columns require data; these have no default values.  Another 
exception is COLOR1, whose default value is 0.7000 for most stars,
or 1.5000 if COLOR1 for stars redder than 1.5000.  Details on all
columns and their defaults below.


 The FITS format data types and byte-lengths (8 bits to a byte) used
for each data item for each star are as follows:
  

  fmt    bytes fields  tot      type			   range
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  A        1     0     0        character		-128 - 127
  B        1     8     8        unsigned integer	   0 - 255
  I        2     25    50       short integer	      -32768 - 32767
  J        4     6     24       long integer	 -2147483648 - 2147483647
  E        4     6     24       float variable	-9.22337e+18 - 9.22337e+18 
  D        8     2     16       double variable	-1.70141e+38 - 1.70141e+38
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
                       122 bytes per star
